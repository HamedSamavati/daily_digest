# daily_digest

## Description
Daily Digest is a Python-based desktop application with a graphical user interface built using Tkinter. The application automates the process of sending daily digest emails to a customizable list of recipients. Users can schedule the email delivery time and select the content to include in the digest, such as a weather forecast for a specific location, a random quote, or a Wikipedia article summary, all fetched via APIs. The intuitive control panel allows users to configure content preferences, manage recipient lists, and set the email dispatch schedule.
